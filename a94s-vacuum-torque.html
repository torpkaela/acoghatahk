Manifold vacuum, or engine vacuum in an internal combustion engine is the difference in air pressure between the engine's intake manifold and Earth's atmosphere.

The Dyson V11 Torque Drive (available at Dyson for 9.99) is the first Dyson cordless vacuum we've tested to that can truly stand toe-to-toe with its corded vacuum cousins. ПРИЛОЖЕНИЕ 1.

With 200 steps per revolution, these in-vacuum stepper motors are ideally suited for the precision movement of delicate specimens inside a high vacuum system. B0132 battery voltage high C-123 B0132 low battery voltage C-123 B0158 outside temperature sensor voltage is too small DIS (Information Display) C-015. Dyson's new V11 Torque Drive vacuum delivers up to 20 percent more powerful suction than the previous Cyclone. I recently bought a 17 Fiesta ST and was wondering if there was a way to use my phone and maybe a Bluetooth OBD2 tool of some kind to display my cars throttle/brake %, Boost/Vacuum, Torque/Horsepower, Engine/Oil Temps? I was hoping I could do this and mount my phone to see this information while driving. I know COBB's Accessport V3 has this information but it all flashes the ECU and I don't want to void the warranty of my brand new car. Thanks a bunch.

So when I bought my truck the seller told me that while the 700R4 transmission should have overdrive the one in this truck "isnt connected" and once i do "connect it" the switch above the electric fans should turn red when flipped. Now I'm not sure if this is standard or a mod he has not fully done to where I truly dont have an overdrive right now or its just automatic and he was trying to set it up to be a manual overdrive. any thoughts. The turbo boost gauge depends on information being correctly entered into the vehicle profile for some types of vehicle. . your vehicle will always measure vacuum . About Torque I own a 2010 Subaru Impreza. It kept turning off and making a weird noise when turning the wheel. So I brought the car to my mechanic and he said "that the car kept cutting off was because of lack of power car needs full tune up with spark plugs, wires etc. the sound is not coming from alternator, it's actually coming from the power steering pump, this is the pulley that sits next to the alternator. The pump is making this noise bc the power steering fluid is totally totally empty. 
There's also a smart sun lamp and a personal air purifier. The weather's warming up, which means spring is almost here. That heralds the cleaning out of musty apartments, students studying for finals and of course, allergy season. Dyson just unveiled a trio of products I'm wondering if maybe my settings in Torque are wrong? Or perhaps whatever sensor reads manifold pressure is failing? Or there's a turbo on my car I've just never been aware of? No I don't really think that. It reads a pretty consistent 22 to 28 inches of mercury vacuum, until I'm accelerating and then it might read like for PSI of positive pressure. Any thoughts on this are appreciated. Hardware Design Considerations for an Efficient Vacuum Cleaner Using a BLDC Motor Application Report  Universal motors have high starting torque, operate at high speed, and are lightweight. Universal motors are also relatively easy to control. However. I've recently had the manifold off and put it back on. I resued the old o-rings for the injectors and the gasket for the manifold. Theres a chance both of these havent ever been changed during the entire life of the car(mk5 golf gti 2006). Is there a chance a faulty/leaking o-ring could be causing this? A single day after i put the manifold back on its throwing this code. The code came after i redlined the car in 4th gear, i was on it full throttle for a good few seconds. I have not noticed. Find great deals on eBay for torque converter vacuum switch. Shop with confidence. Hi everyone, I'm not car savvy at all and I'm hoping someone can give me some insight/advice. I went to the grocery store today, and starting up my car, it was sluggish (felt like it almost didn't want to turn over but did), but I attributed that to the car's age and it being cold outside -- there was frost on the inside of the windshield, to prove that point (I live in northern Quebec, Canada). I got to the store fine, parked, went in and did my shopping. I tried to start the car and though. Download Citation on ResearchGate Vacuum torque A classical and a fully quantum mechanical formalism are introduced for the calculation of the torque experienced by a macro- and a microdipole immersed in an anisotropic homogeneous medium. This is done by obtaining first. 
Tested the spark and they both fire. I found a curious thread that says dual plane intakes will show issues on cylinders 1,6,7,4 if that corresponding side of the carb has clogged idle air ports but it seems 7 and 4 fire OK.

I'm assuming it's the clutch, but thought I'd post and see if anyone here knows better. While I'm driving at a steady speed and increase the throttle, the revs will rise by ~1k with little speed increase then suddenly drop back to where you'd expect with the speed of the car. I think that means it's slipping, but I've seen no other indication I just removed, rebuilt, and replaced the vacuum pump on my 220d. now I've got an oil leak around the pump/block gasket. I cleaned the old gasket. Just curious if anyone out there as installed a ductless mini split AC/Heat unit and have had any issues. I am looking to get one, but I need the single condenser with the 3 indoor heads. I see that Home Depot and other stores have DIY kits, but those are typically not available with multiple heads. The estimates I have gotten seem ridiculous compared to what the systems actually cost (12k for a triple head Mitsubishi system, 8k for a MRCOOL system). I would 
Like compressed air, vacuum puts the atmosphere to work. But unlike compressed air, vacuum uses the surrounding atmosphere to create the work force. I just had to replace our vacuum pump and can’t figure out the torque specs. Currently I have it torqued to 18ft/lbs and there is no oil leaking. Thanks. This is what happens when Unit test was successful but integration testing was skipped before the code runs on production And the we end up felony bug fixing. Looking for reasons why a 1970's turbo 400 transmission won't shift out of first gear. It was recently engine swapped with nearly the exactly same engine, a 350 SBC. The transmission was disconnected from underneath but not removed from the car, although it moved around a little sitting on a jack stand to realign it with a new motor. The transmission worked well before the swap and has had the seal replaced and fluid changed. It currently shifts into all the gears, park, reverse PluginDocumentation. From Torque OBD2 Wiki. Jump to: navigation, search. There is an example 'plugin' that demonstrates how to use the plugin interface in Torque here: - this is a basic example,  Manifold Vacuum 0xff120B GPS Trip distance 0xff120C Vehicle distance (Odometer). So , I understand the difference between the two (supercharger is pulley or shaft driven, while a turbocharger is exhaust driven.) I also understand that while thermal efficiency between the two is roughly equal, a supercharger is slightly more inefficient overall, as the engine directly drives it vs the turbocharger spinning from passing exhaust. Turbos, are generally known for being able to create more power over a larger RPM range (especially with the advent of variable vane turbos) while.

Last week I replaced my alternator. And it wasn't that hard, I saved 0 bucks by doing it myself. So I want to start doing tune ups, fixing minor things, etc in my car. I am a noob, so I'll probably be posting here a lot. But I want to get a tool to help diagnose my car - like the one my mechanic has. What is the best one to get?

So, this isn't a current problem the way I typically drive, but I found myself going past 70mph, and my car started shuddering hard. Like something was kicking back and forth. The tachometer needle bounced around like crazy, a couple hundred RPM difference though I don't have a precise number. Didn't want to drive like this long enough to get one. Accelerating past 75 seemed to start smoothing this out, but with a speed limit of 65 and not wanting to damage things further I decided

I posted last week about a squeaking/squealing/chirping noise that my 2006 3.0 Ranger has been making. Here's the original post. (https://redd.it/872oc5) The noise happens both in park and in gear, is loudest at idle, and occurs even with the belt off. I thought u/KingZiptie had a good suggestion, to double check that the off-brand camshaft synchro I had originally installed hadn't prematurely failed, so today I swapped it out for a genuine Motorcraft.
